Agent,

We're glad to have you back.

Do you remember the C2 group who were exfiltrating confidental data from media firms last year? We never did manage to catch them despite the compelling evidence you uncovered. Well, keeping with the times - they've moved their operations to ransomware and their targets to game companies.

An up and coming game studio has been hit with their strain of ransomware. While the studio managed to restore state from a recent backup, it seems this group are now threatening the company with leaking information on unreleased IP unless a Bitcoin sum is paid. This would be quite damaging to the firm's reputation, so they've asked us to help investigate. We've been in contact with the group and confirmed they've extracted private data. Eerily similar to your findings on the previous case, we've found a bunch of videos going out the network of existing promotional material which has already been released. We suspect they're somehow hiding the confidential data in these videos to avoid suspicion or hitting any data leakage protection signatures.

We've attached one of these videos for you to examine, can you take a look?
