# NOTE TO ADMIN

The main.patch file is included in case someone is seriously struggling to modify the code in a way that works. Essentially they just apply the patch on main.py (from the repo) and it'll work.

Given the skill and caliber of the participants involved, I do not believe this patch file is necessary, but this should be provided as a last resort option as a hint. Please ensure that this deducts significant amount of points from the overall score as this is quite a helping hand.

# Hint

Agent,

How are you getting on with the task?

It appears that you've tried conventional steganography techniques and found nothing, which is very interesting. Nonetheless, do not give up hope. Sometimes, things are best hidden in plain sight, right in front of our eyes. I believe it would be in your best interests to check all aspects of the file again, including any metadata you can extract.

You never know what these criminals are using these days, given their track record, it may be possible they're using some open source tool from some popular code hosting service. If you're going down that route however, remember our usual rules, any open source code must be examined and may require significant modifications. Find out and let me know.

Good luck.

# Hint 2

Agent,

Still having issues? No worries, we got you covered. We did some further digging on the exif metadata on the videos and found an author name in them which doesn't seem to match any employees of the company. Strange, huh? Anyway, here it is: `muziyongshixin`

Find out what this means and who this person is and use that to your advantage.

Good luck.
