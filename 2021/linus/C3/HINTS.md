# Hint

Agent,

Have you tried looking at what WPA enterprise cracking tools are able to accept EAP Challenge and Response values?
Can you use the values provided to turn them into a NETNTLM hash and feed it into well-known tools like hashcat?

We're not sure entirely, but we believe such tool definitely exists.

Good luck.
