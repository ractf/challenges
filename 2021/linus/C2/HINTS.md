# Hint

Agent,

We believe our suspect was staying at a lodge near a big lake surrounded by a series of Lodges and Resorts just north east of Lancaster, England.
Based on the size of the lake in the image, we believe his holiday lodge was on the biggest lake near that location.
It may also help to look at what metadata is contained within the image.

Good luck.
