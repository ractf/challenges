So the image metadata contains a reference to a location north, slightly east of Lancaster surrounded by Lodges and Resorts.

This is where I went on holiday recently, it's clearly Carnforth and it's surrounded by a quite a few lakes. We're interested in the biggest one, so Pine Lake.

Now we just find Pine Lodge and select a good location close to the lake, in the middle of the road between Club Nautique and Pine Lake Resort and submit that.
