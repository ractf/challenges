Agent,

Do you remember the firearms store case from last year? The one they were using as a secret communication platform?

Well, we've located the servers for them, the issue is they're based abroad in a country where we do not have any jurisdiction. Thus, we'll need to gain shell access to their systems the good old way.
They're hosting another webapp again, this time it seems like some early version of a social media network that they're working on. This is good for us as it means there will almost certainly be some vulnerabilities present.

We've linked the webapp for you, can you take a look and see if you can gain access to their server?

> IMPORTANT NOTE: Directory DOSing/Flooding the webapp is strictly off-limits and IS NOT required to solve it. Doing so will hurt the experience for yourself and other users.
